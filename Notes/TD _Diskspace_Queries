    SpaceLeft in MB",(sum(currentperm) / (sum(maxperm)) *100) "% Used" from 
    dbc.diskspace;

8) To find Percent of disk space free on TD server

 SELECT (((SUM (MAXPERM) - (SUM(CURRENTPERM)) - SUM(CURRENTSPOOL)) /

   You can change the value 500000000 to whatever value is appropriate for your site.
   Some sites with more space may have higher tolerance for higher spool usage and   
   Spool limits.

19) To Shows macro space used

CREATE MACRO superspace as (SELECT databasename (char (30)), SUM(maxperm), SUM (currentperm) FROM DBC.DiskSpaceV GROUP BY databasename ORDER BY   Databasename WITH SUM (maxperm), sum (currentperm););

20) To shows TableSizeV View

   The DBC.TableSizeV view provides AMP information about disk space usage at the    table level.Optionally use viewnameVX for information on only those tables that the  
   requesting user owns or has SELECT privileges on.

   SELECT tablename (TITLE 'Table'),currentperm (TITLE 'CurPerm'),vproc (TITLE 'Amp') FROM DBC.tablesizeV WHERE databasename='xxx' AND tablename = 'xxxx' ORDER BY 2 DESC;

   Having sum (currentperm) > 0 ORDER BY 2 desc;

23) To find TableSizeV to report the PERM of tables in a particular database and
   DiskSpaceV to report the PERM of the database

   TableSizeV reports MAX (CurrentPerm) and SUM (CurrentPerm) on all tables in the
   Specified database

   SELECT MAX (CurrentPerm), SUM(CurrentPerm) FROM DBC.TableSizeV
   WHERE DatabaseName = ‘xxxx’;
  
   DiskSpaceV reports MAX (CurrentPerm) and SUM (CurrentPerm) at the database level:

   SELECT MAX (CurrentPerm), SUM(CurrentPerm) FROM DBC.DiskSpaceV
   WHERE DatabaseName = ‘xxxxx’ ;

24) DBC.LogOnOffV View

 The following query returns any failed logon attempts during the last seven days

 SELECT LogDate,LogTime,UserName (FORMAT 'X(10)'),Event FROM DBC.LogOnOffV
 WHERE Event NOT LIKE ('%Logo%') AND LogDate GT DATE – 7 ORDER BY LogDate, 
 LogTime;

25) To find the Max PermSpace on TD Server by using DataBase id

 Select sum (maxpermspace),from DBC.DataBaseSpace where Databaseid='00007408'XB;

  ( '00007408'XB is Database id for the database)

26)
    Select sum ( currentperm) from DBC.TableSize where databasename='xxx' ;

    Select max (currentperm) from DBC.TableSize group by vproc where
    databasename='xxx' ;

    (In above query Max Of current permspace of each amp is less than the  
     Maxpermspace/80(80 is number of amps)

    Amp is full only when it reaches =26528972=2122317760.00(Max Perm Space)/80

    Amp number which is occupied highest space is 50 I.e. 10132992.00 Bytes

27) To find Max PermSpace and Current PermSpace on TD Server  

   Select max (currentperm), max (maxperm) from dbc.diskspace where  
   databasename='xxx';

28) To find Current PermSpace,Effective Space of TableSize and DataBaseName on TD 
    Server by using HASHMAP

   SELECT SUM (CURRENTPERM) ACTUALSPACE, MAX (CURRENTPERM)*(HASHAMP()+1) 
   EFFECTIVESPACE FROM DBC.TABLESIZE WHERE DATABASENAME = 'mydb' AND  
   TABLENAME ='mytable';

   SELECT SUM(CURRENTPERM)/(1024*1024) ACTUALSPACE, 
   (MAX(CURRENTPERM)*(HASHAMP()+1))/(1024*1024) EFFECTIVESPACE
   FROM DBC.TABLESIZE WHERE DATABASENAME = 'DB_NAME' AND TABLENAME =   
   'TABLE_NAME';

29)  To use the below query and you can modify according to your needs

    Select databasename,cast(sum(maxperm)/1024/1024/1024 as decimal(7,2)) 
    max_perm,cast(sum(currentperm)/1024/1024/1024 as decimal(7,2))
    current_perm,cast(sum(maxspool)/1024/1024/1024 as decimal(7,2))
    max_spool,cast(sum(currentspool)/1024/1024/1024 as decimal(7,2)) current_spool   
    from dbc.diskspace where databasename in (select databasename from   
    dbc.databases where dbkind = 'D' and databasename in ('STG_DEV', 'STG_TST_TMP',  
    'WRK_STG_DEV') ) group by databasename order by max_perm desc;

29) Find MAX(CurrentPerm) and SUM(CurrentPerm) in DBC

    select max(CurrentPerm),sum(CurrentPerm) from DBC.DiskSpace

30) DBC.DiskSpace

It provides information about disk space usage (including spool) for any database or   
Account.

SELECT DatabaseName CAST (SUM (MaxPerm) AS FORMAT 'zzz, zzz, zz9’)
, CAST (SUM (CurrentPerm) AS FORMAT 'zzz, zzz,zz9’),CAST (((SUM (CurrentPerm))/
NULLIFZERO (SUM (MaxPerm)) * 100) AS FORMAT ’zz9.99 %') AS "% Used"
FROM   DBC.DiskSpace GROUP BY   1 ORDER BY   4 DESC;

31)  DBC.TableSize

  It provides information about disk space usage (excluding spool) for any database, table or account.
   SELECT  Vproc ,CAST (TableName AS FORMAT 'X(20)') ,CurrentPerm,PeakPerm
   FROM   DBC.TableSize WHERE DatabaseName = USER ORDER BY  TableName, Vproc ;

32) DBC.AllSpace

  It provides information about disk space usage (including spool) for any database,    
  table,or account.
    SELECT  Vproc,CAST (TableName AS  FORMAT 'X(20)') ,MaxPerm,CurrentPerm
    FROM   DBC.AllSpace WHERE DatabaseName = USER   
    ORDER BY   TableName, Vproc ;

33) You can play with SQL to SUM up the database to get total count of database or you  
   Can simply use the
     view diskspace;   (to get the totals across the whole database)

34) Data Skew Check

1) First check to see if the primary index is ok for tables system-wide:

SEL (MAX(CurrentPerm) - MIN(CurrentPerm)) * 100/(NULLIF(MIN(currentperm),0))
(NAMED variance)(FORMAT 'zzzzz9.99%'),MAX(CurrentPerm)(TITLE 'Max')
(FORMAT 'zzz,zzz,zzz,999'),MIN(currentperm)(TITLE 'Min')(FORMAT 'zzz,zzz,zzz,999'),TRIM(DatabaseName)||'.'||TableName (NAMED Tables)
FROM DBC.tablesizeGROUP BY DatabaseName, TableNameHAVING SUM(CurrentPerm) > 1000000 AND variance > 1000 WHERE DatabaseName NOT IN ('CrashDumps','DBC')
ORDER BY Tables;

2) If this is not the case, try to identify the job that might be responsible for the concentration of IO and cpu by checking spool usage by vproc:

WHERE A.accountname = DT.accountName AND A.username = DT.username
AND CpuRatio > 1.30 ORDER BY 5, 1, 2, 3;

3) Once you have identified the application, check the tables involved to see if secondary indexes are skewed or if the access to the tables is causing a concentration on the clique...

/* The following query will provide the distribution by amp for a given index or column. */

select  hashamp (hashbucket(hashrow(index or column))),count(*) from database.table
group by 1 order by 2 desc;

/* The following query will provide the number of collisions  for row hash. */

select hashrow(index or column), count(*) from database.table group by 1 order by 1 having count(*) > 10;

35) To find out I/O and CPU Usage from this data Dictionary Table DBC.AMPUSAGE
  
   SELECT ACCOUNTNAME, USERNAME,SUM(CPUTIME) AS CPU,SUM (DISKIO)
   AS DISKIO FROM DBC.AMPUSAGE GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3 DESC;

36) Find the total space in your system

    Select sum (maxperm) from dbc.diskspace;

37) How to find CYLINDERS
   Go to - >Teradata Manager ->Select MENU -> Investigate then “Space Usage”, then  
   “Cylinders by vproc “. it tells you the number of available cylinders. Now, divide the   
   Total space by the number of cylinders to get the size of a cylinder.

38)  SELECT databasename ,SUM ((((MaxPerm) / 1024) /1024) / 1024) AS   
     Maximum_Space_GB ,SUM ((((CurrentPerm) / 1024) /1024) / 1024) AS  
     Current_Space_Used_GB,((100-Percent_Used)*Maximum_Space_GB)/100 AS  
     Free_Space_GB,(Current_Space_Used_GB / NULLIFZERO (Maximum_Space_GB) *  
     100 ) (FORMAT 'zz9.99%' , TITLE 'Percent // Used') AS Percent_Used,
     (Free_Space_GB / NULLIFZERO (Maximum_Space_GB)) FROM        DBC.DISKSPACE  
     Group By 1 ORDER       BY 5 DESC;

Here is SQL to show you a user's max spool (amount allocated) and peak spool (highest amount used):
SELECT DATABASENAME (Title 'User'),sum(MaxSpool) (format '---,---,---,---,--9')(char(19))(title 'max Spool'),sum(PeakSpool) (format '---,---,---,---,--9')(char(19))(title 'Peak Spool'),sum(Maxtemp) (format '---,---,---,---,--9')(char(19))(title 'max temp'),sum(PeakTemp) (format '---,---,---,---,--9')(char(19))(title 'Peak Temp') FROM DBC.DISKSPACE
WHERE DatabaseName = 'DBNAME' ORDER BY 1 GROUP BY 1;

Here is SQL to give you information including spool and temporary space allocations for a user:

SELECT A.DatabaseName (CHAR(20)), A.OwnerName (CHAR(20)), A.AccountName (CHAR(20)), B.DefaultDatabase (CHAR(20)), (A.SpoolSpace / 1000000000) (NAMED Spool_In_gig), (A.TempSpace / 1000000000) (NAMED Temp_In_gig)
FROM DBC.DATABASES  A, DBC.DBASE  B WHERE A.DatabaseName = B.DatabaseNamei
AND A.DatabaseName = 'Joe_User' ORDER BY 1;

39) Deleting DBQL tables should not cause any problem.

Two steps for a cleanup job could be:

(1)  Insert selects the rows to a private database if you want to keep some history. Consider using (empty) staging tables for optimized insert-select.


(2)  Delete DBC.DBQL* tables (except for the RuleTbl and RuleCountTbl which anyways you can't). If you are deleting based on date then use collectiontimestamp on all but DBQLogTbl. We use Start Time to delete from DBQLogTbl as the collectiontimestamp is way off in this table (may be a bug)
